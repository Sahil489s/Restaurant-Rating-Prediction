# Restaurant-Rating-Prediction
Overview
This repository contains the first project assigned during my Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The project focuses on data exploration and preprocessing as part of Level-1 tasks.

Project Objectives
Perform data exploration to identify trends and anomalies.
Clean and preprocess the dataset for further analysis.
Visualize the data for better insights.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Google Colab: Development environment.
Dataset
The dataset is loaded into the project using Pandas. Ensure the dataset is available locally or in the specified path.

Project Highlights
Data Exploration:
Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Identified and handled missing or inconsistent data.
Preprocessing:
Applied necessary transformations for a clean dataset.
Prepared the data for further levels of analysis.
Future Work
This project represents Level-1 of the internship tasks. Future tasks will involve advanced machine learning techniques and deployment.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Cognifyz Technologies for providing this learning opportunity and guiding me through the internship journey.
